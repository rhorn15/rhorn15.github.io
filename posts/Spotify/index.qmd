Here are some interesting analytics related to spotify!

![](Spotify Image.jpeg)
```{r, setup, include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# Load your data
spotify_all <- read.csv("/Users/ryanm/Documents/GIT for Rstudio/rhorn15.github.io/posts/Spotify/spotify_all.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)

Q1c <- spotify_all %>%
  group_by(artist_name) %>%
  mutate(n_popular_artist = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(artist_ranking = dense_rank(desc(n_popular_artist))) %>%
  filter(artist_ranking <= 10)

```

```{r, fig.cap="Boxplot of Artist Rankings", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Q1c) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = pos), binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_grid(fct_reorder(artist_name, artist_ranking) ~ .  , switch = "y") +
  theme(strip.text.y.left = element_text(angle = 0))

```
Here we can see that "pos" (position of track within a playlist), doesn't vary a significant amount between these top ten artists.

```{r, echo=FALSE}


ggplot(spotify_all, aes(x = pos)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Track Positions in Playlists",
       x = "Track Position",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()


```

This histogram visualizes the distribution of track positions within playlists.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
top_artists <- spotify_all %>%
  group_by(artist_name) %>%
  summarise(total_tracks = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_tracks)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

ggplot(top_artists, aes(x = reorder(artist_name, -total_tracks), y = total_tracks, fill = artist_name)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Artists in Playlists",
       x = "Artist Name",
       y = "Total Tracks in Playlists") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
This bar plot shows the top 10 artists based on the total number of tracks in playlists.
