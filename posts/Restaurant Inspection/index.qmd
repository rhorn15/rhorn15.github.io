```{r, setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
restaurant <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_wrap( "CRITICAL FLAG" ~ GRADE, scales = 'free' )
```
As we can see from the graph above, data from NYC restaurants, critical score varies more as the you move from category A,  B, and C.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_bar (aes(x = "CRITICAL FLAG",
               y = after_stat(prop), group = 1)) +
  facet_grid( GRADE ~ BORO )
```
For this graph, we can see that the distribution of CRITICAL FLAG is similar across all the boros.
