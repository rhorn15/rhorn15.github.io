```{r, setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
restaurant <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = SCORE), binwidth = 1 ) +
  facet_wrap( "CRITICAL FLAG" ~ GRADE, scales = 'free' )
```
As we can see from the graph above, data from NYC restaurants, critical score varies more as the you move from category A,  B, and C.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

top_cuisines <- restaurant %>%
  group_by(CUISINE.DESCRIPTION) %>%
  summarise(total_restaurants = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_restaurants)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

ggplot(top_cuisines, aes(x = reorder(CUISINE.DESCRIPTION, -total_restaurants), y = total_restaurants, fill = CUISINE.DESCRIPTION)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Cuisine Types",
       x = "Cuisine Type",
       y = "Number of Restaurants") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
This bar plot shows the top 10 cuisine types based on the number of restaurants.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(restaurant, aes(x = SCORE)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "orange", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Inspection Scores",
       x = "Score",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

```

This histogram visualizes the distribution of inspection scores for restaurants.
