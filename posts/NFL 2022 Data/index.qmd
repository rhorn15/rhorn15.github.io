Here is some analytics in relation to Data from the 2022 NFL season!

## Q2a 

In data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs, remove observations for which values of posteam is missing.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
NFL2022_stuffs <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NFL2022_stuffs.csv')
library(dplyr)
```

*Answer:*

```{r}
NFL2022_stuffs_cleaned <- NFL2022_stuffs %>% 
  filter(!is.na(posteam))

head(NFL2022_stuffs_cleaned)
```

## Q2b

-Summarize the mean value of pass for each posteam when all the following conditions hold:

1. wp is greater than 20% and less than 75%;

2. down is less than or equal to 2; and

3. half_seconds_remaining is greater than 120

*Answer:*

```{r}

filtered_data <- NFL2022_stuffs %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(posteam),       
    wp > 0.2 & wp < 0.75,   
    down <= 2,              
    half_seconds_remaining > 120  
  )

summary_data <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(posteam) %>%
  summarize(mean_pass = mean(pass, na.rm = TRUE))

print(summary_data)

```
## Q2c

-Provide both (1) a ggplot code with geom_point() using the resulting data.frame in Q2b and (2) a simple comments to describe the mean value of pass for each posteam.
  *In the ggplot, reorder the posteam categories based on the mean value of pass in ascending or in descending order.*
  
*Answer:*

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
result <- NFL2022_stuffs %>%
  filter(
    wp > 0.2 & wp < 0.75,
    down <= 2,
    half_seconds_remaining > 120
  ) %>%
  group_by(posteam) %>%
  summarise(mean_pass = mean(pass, na.rm = TRUE))

result$posteam <- factor(result$posteam, levels = result$posteam[order(result$mean_pass)])

ggplot(result, aes(x = posteam, y = mean_pass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mean Value of Pass for Each posteam",
       x = "posteam",
       y = "Mean Pass Value") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```
## Q2d

- Create the data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, that includes

1. All the variables in the data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs;

2. The variables, passer, receiver, and epa, from the data.frame, NFL2022_epa. by joining the two data.frames.

- In the resulting data.frame, NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, remove observations with NA in passer.
  
  
*Answer:*

```{r}

NFL2022_epa <- read.csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/NFL2022_epa.csv')

NFL2022_stuffs_EPA <- left_join(NFL2022_stuffs, NFL2022_epa, by = c("play_id", "game_id", "drive", "posteam"))

NFL2022_stuffs_EPA <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>%
  filter(!is.na(passer))

head(NFL2022_stuffs_EPA)

```

## Q2e

- Provide both (1) a single ggplot and (2) a simple comment to describe the NFL weekly trend of weekly mean value of epa for each of the following two passers,

1. "J.Allen"
2. "P.Mahomes"

*Answer:*

```{r}

ggplot(NFL2022_stuffs_EPA, aes(x = week, y = epa, color = passer, linetype = passer)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "NFL Weekly Trend of Mean EPA for Passers",
       x = "Week",
       y = "Mean EPA") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("J.Allen" = "blue", "P.Mahomes" = "red")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = c("J.Allen" = "solid", "P.Mahomes" = "dashed")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
This line plot illustrates the weekly trend of the mean value of Expected Points Added (EPA) for two excellent passers. 

## Q2f

- Calculate the difference between the mean value of epa for "J.Allen" the mean value of epa for "P.Mahomes" for each value of week.

*Answer:*

```{r}
epa_difference <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(mean_epa_difference = mean(epa[passer == "J.Allen"]) - mean(epa[passer == "P.Mahomes"]))

print(epa_difference)

```

## Q2g

- Summarize the resulting data.frame in Q2d, with the following four variables:

  - posteam: String abbreviation for the team with possession.
  - passer: Name of the player who passed a ball to a receiver by initially taking a three-step drop, and backpedaling into the pocket to make a pass. (Mostly, they are quarterbacks.)
  - mean_epa: Mean value of epa in 2022 for each passer
  - n_pass: Number of observations for each passer
- Then find the top 10 NFL passers in 2022 in terms of the mean value of epa, conditioning that n_pass must be greater than or equal to the third quantile level of n_pass.

*Answer:*

```{r}

passer_summary <- NFL2022_stuffs_EPA %>%
  group_by(posteam, passer) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_pass = n()
  )

quantile_threshold <- quantile(passer_summary$n_pass, 0.75)

top_passers <- passer_summary %>%
  filter(n_pass >= quantile_threshold) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_epa)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

print(top_passers)

```
